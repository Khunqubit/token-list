  description: Paizul, the charismatic and brilliant leader of the ONI consortium,
    vividly recalls the first time she saw her one true love. It was a warm
    summer day, full of raging ionic storms. Lightning was piercing the sky as
    Bekalu took off his helmet and locked eyes with her. 'What are the chances
    of nearly colliding with someone flying through these wastelands on a day
    like this', he smiled with his booming voice. 'Perhaps it's destiny,' she
    smiled back mysteriously. There was another strike of lightning, but this
    time the sky remained calm.
