  description: The rogue planet, Iris, dense with invaluable materials, draws in
    and collides with seven child planets in a remote region of space, creating
    what is henceforth referred to as 'The Cataclysm'. When combined, these
    eight elements create a form of free energy. The collision creates a
    massively valuable debris field.
