  description: He thought it would be just another routine exploration mission.
    Get there, scan, save data blocks and return. But when a surprise radiation
    storm knocked out his spaceship and swept him up into its high-velocity
    current, the only thing that saved him from certain doom was his custom ion
    shield.
