  description: The sound of wailing echoes across the plains. The Sogmian
    procession solemnly marches in step past their ancestors' gravestones, still
    haunted by the fate of their leader. The sun begins to set as they bring
    Paizul's cryopod at the top of the Rock of Light. As a beam of light
    consumes the pod to upload it to eternal rest with the ancients, Bekalu
    falls to his knees with a wrathful howl. The crowd is rattled to the core, a
    foreboding of things to come.
