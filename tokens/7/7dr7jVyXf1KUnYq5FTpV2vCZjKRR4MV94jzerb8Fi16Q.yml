  description: Suffering one of the cruelest fates in the universe, the Sogmian
    race of aliens was driven to the brink of extinction. With only 10,000
    members left, they put all hope of salvation in the hands of their leader
    Paizul. After she was assassinated in a gruesome public way, so much fear
    was struck in the hearts of survivors that they set out to build their 'Last
    Stand'.
